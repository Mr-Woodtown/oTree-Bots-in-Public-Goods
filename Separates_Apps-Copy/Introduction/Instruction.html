<body><h1 class="c12" id="h.ryqzvab5i247"><span class="c0 c13">Public Goods Game Instructions</span></h1><h3 class="c4" id="h.yp72wl5q83xd">
    <span class="c6 c0">Overview</span></h3>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We will assign you a participant ID. It will not be linked to you personally. It can only identify demographic information that you provide over the course of the study. Please keep it with you at all times. You may write on it if you wish, but make sure you do not write over the ID number.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At the end of the experiment, we&#39;ll ask you to complete a brief survey. Your answers will remain confidential and will be used only to help us analyze the results&mdash;they won&#39;t be shared publicly and will remain confidential.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span>You will be playing a decision-making game that lasts </span><span class="c0">10 rounds</span><span>. In each round, every participant will receive </span><span class="c0">$1.00</span><span>. You must decide how much of that $1.00 to keep for yourself and how much to contribute to a </span><span class="c0">group pot</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c14">Communicating to other participants is not allowed while the game is running. You forfeit all payout except your show-up bonus by doing so.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>Asking a question to a researcher at any time is allowed, though they may not answer your questio</span><span>n in order to not reveal the mechanism of the game.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c4" id="h.depj9jgh26h"><span class="c6 c0">Round Flow</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span>&#9679;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You receive $1.00.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c10"><span>&#9679;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>You decide how much to contribute (anywhere from $0.00 to $1.00).
        <br>
        <br>&#9679;</span>
        <span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The total contributions are multiplied by 1.6.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c10"><span>&#9679;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>The multiplied pot is divided equally among all players.<br><br>&#9679;</span>
        <span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Your round payoff = (money you kept) + (your share of the pot).</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span>This process repeats for </span><span class="c0">10 rounds</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">You may leave the experiment at any time and receive your show-up bonus; however, you will forfeit any payout you would receive from the results of the game.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c4" id="h.y1s1v75mgcjz"><span class="c0 c6">Treatment</span></h3>
    <p class="c3"><span>There may be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;automated &ldquo;bots&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;in your group. If there were no bots in your group, it would consist of </span><span class="c0">4 human </span><span>participants. If there were </span><span class="c0">1 bot</span><span>&nbsp;in your group, the remaining </span><span class="c0">3 participants</span><span>&nbsp;would be human. If there were </span><span class="c0">2 bots</span><span>&nbsp;in your group, the remaining </span><span class="c0">2 participants</span><span>&nbsp;would be human. Should there be more than one bot, each would replace one human participant in the group. These bots, if present, value their own payout and follow a </span><span class="c0">consistent strategy</span><span>.<br><br></span><span class="c0 c7">Before the start of the first round, you will be informed if your group consists of 4 human participants or 2 bots and 2 humans.</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.le54bc5qqce1"><span class="c6 c0">Important Notes</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span>&#9679;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>Each round is </span><span class="c0">independent</span><span>. You always start with a new $1 and no more.<br><br>&#9679;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Your decisions are private, but the group results (pot size and payouts) will be shown after each round.<br></span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>&#9679;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">There are no &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; choices.</span></p>
    <p class="c11"><span class="c1"></span></p>
